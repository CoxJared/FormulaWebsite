                &nbsp; Airflow over, around and through the car is the focus of aerodynamic analysis of our Formula car. The main objectives of the aero package is to minimize drag and maximize downforce (negative lift).  Through multiple iterations and CFD analysis our current aero package was designed. All components of the package are manufactured using carbon composites through the vacuum infusion process
