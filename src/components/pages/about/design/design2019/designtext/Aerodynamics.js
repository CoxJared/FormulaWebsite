                Airflow over, around and through the car is the focus of aerodynamic analysis of our Formula car. The main objectives of the aero package is to minimize drag and maximize downforce (negative lift).  Through multiple iterations and CFD analysis our current aero package was finalized.  Comprising of a front and rear wing, side pods and an undertray the aero pack has been optimized to increase handling, resulting in peak performance.  All components of the package were first molded in house and then manufactured with various carbon fibre layups to optimize weight savings are strength.
