                &nbsp; After analyzing tire test data, our team decided to use 10‚Äù Hoosier LCO tires because of 
                their superior grip capabilities. A thorough analysis of tire test data allowed the team to 
                determine the acceleration limits of the tires and use this to better understand the loads that the 
                suspension will likely encounter. MAC Formula Electric chooses to use a pushrod style set up 
                because of its lightweight and highly adjustable capabilities. Finally, we chose to incorporate highly  
                adjustable dampers into the system because of their use of twin tube damping technology designed  
                specifically for FSAE cars.
