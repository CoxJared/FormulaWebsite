            This year, we developed our first high-voltage battery with three priorities: high specific-power, high specific-energy, and optimized weight. This design will be capable of providing the maximum power to the vehicle for the entirety of the endurance run. With a charge time of approximately 35 minutes, we are able to reduce the downtime between runs and improve our teams overall efficiency.
