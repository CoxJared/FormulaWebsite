                &nbsp; Our chassis centres around a Carbon Composite monocoque with a foam Core.  This was achieved through a vacuum infusion process and oven cure.  With multiple different carbon thicknesses, orientations and weaves we have produced a structurally sound and feather light base for our car.  To ensure the reliability of our layup analysis, all of the various layups in the chassis have been 3-point bend tested and tested in shear.
