The process went through the stages of theoretical analysis and preliminary design, translated into feasible designs validated by both FEA and physical testing of basic composite strength characteristics. All that was learned from this process was applied to a full chassis design which was built 100% by dedicated students on the team. The result represents an impressive carbon body for our car and an excellent baseline for future members to learn from and improve upon.",

The vinyl sheets were then given a wipe-down, measured, and cut for each panel accordingly.  The backing of the vinyl was finally peeled off and placed on the corresponding panel while air bubbles were being worked out of the vinyl through a combination of using heat guns, stretching the vinyl, and specialized vinyl wrapping tools.

                MAC Formula Electric began as a small group of dedicated students who have grown the team into what it is now, a team of over 80 active members working on various aspects of the car.  The team spans over all engineering faculties as well as applied sciences, creating a well rounded and functional group dynamic. As the group of original founding members graduated this past year, our team has embraced the opportunity to re-structure and accept new, ambitious young engineering students who will build upon what has been achieved so far. The team is currently completing the build phase of our fully electric, all wheel drive, Formula 1 style racecar.  Here are some of the milestones we have achieved this year.
