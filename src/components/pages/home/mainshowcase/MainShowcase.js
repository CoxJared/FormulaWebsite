		'Every year, the team starts out be creating new goals. From there, a plan of action is formed, deadlines are established, and tasks are distributed between team members. Although Formula Student is an engineering competition, the team requires more than just engineering students. As a result, a conscious effort is made to appeal to students with a variety of backgrounds, interests, and areas of study. This ensures that we have the best people in the right roles. The team then proceeds to budget and design the car. Once this task is completed simulations are run to optimize the theoretical designs. From there, manufacturing and assembly of components commence. Once the car is completed, a demanding testing regime ensures validation of designs before the car and team are sent to competition.',

By using electric vehicles as a platform for inn ovation the team hopes to promote the development of a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable future.  High Performance With efficiencies of over 90%, electric motors are able to transmit a higher percentage of power to the wheels than an internal combustion engine. Moreover, with the ability to provide maximum torque at any speed, performance figures for MAC Formula Electricâ€™s first car rival the top combustion and hybrid automobiles. Future of Transportation By getting hands-on experience in high-performance, environmentally-friendly technologies, our members are well equipped for the industry that awaits them upon graduation.',
